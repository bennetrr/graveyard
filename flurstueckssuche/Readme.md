# Flurst√ºckssuche

This project was developed for our district administration to help them to find properties in QGIS.

Because there was no infrastructure where we could get our data from, we had to loop over a QGIS layer.
This makes the search really slow, and the district administration created their own script with a searchable API in the background.
The new plugin can also be found on GitHub: [hkreis-viersen/flurstuecksfinder-nrw](https://github.com/kreis-viersen/flurstuecksfinder-nrw)
