# Vertretungsplan

This is a simple substitution plan for schools built with PHP and MySQL.

I created this because the substitution plan our school had for a time was really bad.
But then our school started to use WebUntis, which is not as bad as the software used before, and I stopped to develop this project, also because I began to hate PHP.
