# VanillaBedwars

This is the first version of VanillaBedwars (now just called Bedwars).
This version uses command blocks and a Minecraft Datapack.

You can find the new version on GitHub: [bennetrr/bedwars](https://github.com/bennetrr/bedwars).
There is also a map you can download, although all command blocks are missing. [World Download](https://github.com/bennetrr/bedwars/releases/download/1.0.0-test1/bedwarsMap_1.0.0-test1.zip)
