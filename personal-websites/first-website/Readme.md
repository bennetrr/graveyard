# My first website

This is the first website I 've created. Nothing more.

Featuring projects that I never started, an admin dashboard with useless tools, GitHub releases in really, really bad, and a link shortener.

## Preview Server

Start the server:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

You can access the website on `http://localhost:3456`.

Stop the server:

```bash
docker compose down
```
