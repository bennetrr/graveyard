# Layer Geocode

This QGIS plugin allows to geocode (= get the nearest address to a point on the map) an entire layer using OpenStreetMaps Nominatim API.

It was discontinued because it violates the Usage Policy of OpenStreetMaps, and, depending on the amount of points, could get your IP blocked.
